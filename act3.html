                <h2>Strawberry Taho</h2>
                <p>Strawberry taho is one of Baguio’s most iconic street foods, offering a delicious twist on the classic Filipino snack. Instead of traditional caramel syrup, Baguio’s version uses a rich, tangy strawberry sauce made from freshly harvested strawberries. This gives the taho a balance of sweetness and tartness, complementing the soft silken tofu and chewy sago pearls. Vendors roam around popular spots like Burnham Park, calling out "Taho!" as they serve this warm and comforting treat.</p>

                <h2>Pinikpikan</h2>
                <p>Pinikpikan is a traditional Cordilleran dish deeply rooted in indigenous culture. This savory chicken soup is prepared using a unique method—before cooking, the chicken is lightly beaten, enhancing its flavor by keeping the blood inside the meat. The chicken is then roasted and boiled with native herbs and vegetables like sayote. Some variations include etag, a smoked and salted pork that adds a rich umami taste. Pinikpikan is a must-try for those looking to experience authentic local flavors.</p>
