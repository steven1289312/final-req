        <h2>History of Baguio</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Baguio City, known as the Summer Capital of the Philippines, has a rich and fascinating history. Originally home to the Ibaloi people, the area was transformed into a hill station by the Americans in the early 1900s due to its cool climate and picturesque landscape. The city’s layout was designed by the American architect Daniel Burnham, emphasizing green spaces, wide roads, and a structured urban plan.</p>
                <p>During World War II, Baguio played a significant role and was occupied by Japanese forces. The city suffered heavy bombings towards the war's end but quickly recovered, evolving into a vital hub for tourism, education, and culture. Today, Baguio preserves its indigenous heritage while embracing modern developments, making it a dynamic and historically significant city in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>The establishment of Baguio as a chartered city in 1909 marked a turning point in its development. It became a favored retreat for government officials and expatriates, leading to the construction of iconic landmarks such as Burnham Park and Camp John Hay. These historical sites remain integral to the city’s charm and attract visitors year-round.</p>
                <p>Throughout the years, Baguio has become a center for education, housing several prestigious universities and institutions. The city's academic excellence, combined with its artistic heritage, fosters a culture of creativity and intellectual growth.</p>
